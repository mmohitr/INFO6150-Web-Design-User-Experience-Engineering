## Project Description

The project aims to help users track all of their expenses and have an overview of their entire expenditure over a period of time. 

Users can save expenses into multiple categories and have the option of selecting a transaction type for each expense - where it is an 'expense' or 'income' type transaction. They can view and manage their transactions in an analytical dashboard which consists of charts showing the total number of transactions and the total turnover amount. <br>
